The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a federal statute enacted in 1996 with the primary objectives of modernizing the flow of healthcare information, addressing limitations of healthcare insurance coverage, and protecting healthcare data from theft and fraud.  With regards to protecting healthcare data from theft and fraud, covered entities and their business associates are required under the HIPAA Privacy Rule to develop policies and procedures that protect individually identifiable health information against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction (hereafter referred to as Protected Health Information or PHI).  It is a further requirement of the Privacy Rule that covered entities train all employees on policies and procedures relating to PHI and how to report a breach of unsecured PHI; while the Security Rule states covered entities must implement a security awareness and training program for all members of the workforce. The failure to comply with the HIPAA training requirements is a violation of HIPAA.  Although not directly stipulated by HIPAA, business associates should also provide HIPAA training to employees in order that they can deliver a compliant service to the covered entity. Covered entities are required to conduct due diligence on business associates and other covered entities with whom they share PHI, and it is important for service providers to have a trained and compliant workforce.
